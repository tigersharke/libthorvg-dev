This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/graphics/libthorvg-dev so that those who desire may obtain and build their own.  This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there.  My commits to be ONE day behind in order to avoid multiple commits of the same date.

This library is actually used by godot.
